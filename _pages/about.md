I am an electrical engineer with 3-year work experience of flight simulator avionic system software especially Aircraft Ancillaries System (ANC)[^anc] and Flight Surveillance System (FSS)[^fss] .

Due to flight simulator market is shrinking during the pendamic COVID-19, I've lost my job. Now, I am looking for an experience-related job as well as any other IT programming jobs of website, desktop application and embeded system software development using C++, JAVA and PYTHON or any other languages. I am a quick leanrner of new programming languages.
